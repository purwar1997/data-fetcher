## Description

This project is a React app that fetches data from a public API and renders it inside a card. API returns data of a random user which is then being stored in browser's local storage. This app also has three buttons that can be used to browse between different users.

## What I learnt from building this project -

- State management of a React app using `useState` hook
- Using `useEffect` hook to perform asynchronous operations like fetching data
- Sending HTTP requests to a public API using `Axios` client
- Using browser's `local storage` to store fetched data
